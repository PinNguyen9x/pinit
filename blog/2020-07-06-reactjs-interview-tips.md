**AGENDA:**

1. General reminders
2. Review JS/ReactJS knowledge
3. Practice algorithms
4. Research the company youâ€™re applying to

> Note:
>
> - Each company has its own interview style, so use this as a reference, not a rule. ðŸ˜‰
> - This guide is applicable to all levels: from junior to senior. The questions may vary in difficulty or scope based on your level.

## General reminders

A typical interview usually consists of the following parts:

- Introductions and greetings.
- Discussing your work experience, focusing on your most recent project.
- Problem-solving exercises:
  - Handling real-life work scenarios.
  - Coding exercises involving algorithms.
- Learning about your aspirations and expectations.
- Asking questions about the company or the projects you'll work on if hired.

---

Reminders before and during the interview:

- **Attire:** Dress neatly, but thereâ€™s no need to overdo it. IT folks donâ€™t need to look glamorous ðŸ˜„. A simple outfit like jeans and a t-shirt works fine. No need for formal shirts. ðŸ˜‰
- **Timing:** Arrive 10-15 minutes earlyâ€”not right on time. This gives you a moment to relax before starting. ðŸ˜œ But donâ€™t arrive too early either, like 30 minutes, as that might be awkward. ðŸ˜…
- **Contact:** Ask for a `phone number` in advance so you can inquire about parking, elevators, the correct floor, etc., if needed.
- **Attitude:** Show a willingness to `learn and explore new things`. Avoid being rigid or saying, "I only know this; I don't want to explore new technologies." Such attitudes may not fare well.
- **Stay calm and natural:** This depends on individual mindset and isnâ€™t easy to achieve. Take a deep breath, exhale, and try to stay `calm`. Be as natural as possible. If you need water, politely ask for a glass instead of staying thirsty and struggling to speak.
- **Be honest:** Itâ€™s impossible to `know everything`. If you donâ€™t know the answer, `be honest` and say youâ€™ll look into it. For example: "I find this very interesting, and if given the opportunity, Iâ€™ll definitely study and learn more about it." ðŸ˜‰
- **Understand your own aspirations:**
  - What do you want to do at this company?
  - Which technologies do you want to learn?
  - Are you aiming for a technical or management career path?
  - Do you have a personal plan to achieve your goals?
    If you donâ€™t know what you want, how will you determine if the company is right for you?

## 1. Review JS/ReactJS knowledge

This is to prepare for questions about your most recent project. Depending on what you mention as your expertise, youâ€™ll be asked related questions.

> TIP: Donâ€™t overstate your knowledge. If youâ€™re asked follow-up questions, it may backfire. ðŸ˜‰

### HTML/CSS

- Layout with flexbox or grid.
- Questions about UI libraries youâ€™ve used: Bootstrap, Material Design, Ant Design.
- Layout design strategies.
- Given a UI design, explain how youâ€™d implement it (conceptual, not coding).
- How do you organize styles in your project?
- What is BEM? How do you apply it?
- SCSS: What features have you used?
- CSS specificity.
- How to customize the styles of a UI library.
- Reset CSS vs Normalize CSS.
- ...

### JAVASCRIPT

- "use strict".
- Differences between var, const, and let.
- Block scope vs Function scope.
- What is hoisting? This might involve explaining a code snippet.
- Closure.
- Value type vs reference type.
- Asynchronous JavaScript.
- setTimeout(), setInterval().
- Callback.
- Promise.
- Modules in JavaScript: import, export, etc.
- ES6 features: arrow functions, for...of, async/await, etc.
- Problem-solving scenarios using JavaScript knowledge.
- ...

### REACTJS

- Component vs PureComponent.
- Lifecycle methods: which one to use for what purpose (check my YouTube channel for more on this ðŸ˜‰).
- Differentiate between `component state`, `Context API`, and `Redux`: when and why to use each.
- **Refs in ReactJS**: Have you used them? If so, for what purpose? If not, you might be asked to solve a problem using refs.
- Nested routing: What is it, and when is it needed?
- Setting up routing for pages requiring login.
- Which form management library do you use: `Formik`, `Redux-Form`, `React-Hook-Form`? Each has its own set of questions.
- **Authentication**: How do you handle authentication in an app? Token management, refresh tokens, expired tokens? (advanced topic).
- **React hooks**: Which hooks do you use, and for what purpose?
- **Custom hooks**: Have you written any? If yes, explain its purpose.
- Redux Toolkit: What is it?
- Facebookâ€™s state management library `Recoil`: Have you heard about it? What are your thoughts? ðŸ¤£
- Common libraries you use in ReactJS projects.
- ...

## 2. Practice algorithms

This can vary widely, so itâ€™s hard to predict the exact questions. Prepare thoroughly. Usually, the interviewer provides a problem, and you analyze it to find a solution.

- Basic search and sorting.
- Longest or shortest substring variations.
- Recursion.
- Finding a "mystery number" in an array meeting specific conditions.
- Graphs (rarely asked).
- Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Observer).
- Code snippets: determine the output and explain.
- Dynamic programming (advanced, rarely asked unless the company specializes in algorithms).
- ... It depends on your logical skills.

## 3. Research the company youâ€™re applying to

**Learn about the company:**

- What field does the company operate in?
- Company size?
- When was it established?
- Projects the company has worked on.
- Reviews about the company.
- ...

**Ask about the project youâ€™ll work on if hired:**

- What is the project about?
- Technologies and tech stack used.
- Team size and who youâ€™ll work with.
- Is the team friendly and collaborative?
- ... Ask anything you care about regarding your future team.
